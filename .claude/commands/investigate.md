description: Investigate a Kubernetes workload, service, node, or operator target.
argument-hint: [task]
allowed-tools: mcp__kagent__invoke_agent
---

Use the `mcp__kagent__invoke_agent` tool.

- Set `agent` to `kagent/homelab-k8s-custom-agent`.
- Treat this command as the generic investigation path.
- Build `task` as this deterministic wrapper, then append the user's arguments verbatim under `Original user request:`.
- Wrapper header:
  `[INVESTIGATION_ENTRYPOINT]=generic`
  `Use build_investigation_report as the top-level report entrypoint.`
  `If the target is vague, resolve it first with find_unhealthy_pod before calling build_investigation_report.`
- Do not use this command as the primary alert entrypoint. Use `/investigate-alert` for alert triage.
- Return the agent's result directly.
- Treat this command as read-only investigation help. Do not take write actions, cleanup actions, or mutation requests through this command.
- If no arguments were supplied, ask the user what they want investigated.
